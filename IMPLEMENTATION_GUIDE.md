## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

#### Day 1-2: Environment Setup
1. Run `setup.sh` to create project structure
2. Configure AWS credentials in `.env` file
3. Set up Git repository and initial commit
4. Review architecture diagram and documentation

#### Day 3-4: Task 1 - Base Infrastructure
1. Copy Task 1 from `tasks.md`
2. Generate Terraform code using LLM
3. Review and customize the generated code
4. Deploy to dev environment:
   ```bash
   cd terraform/environments/dev
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

#### Day 5-7: Task 9 - Security Setup
1. Implement security module (Task 9)
2. This includes IAM roles, policies, and KMS keys
3. Required for other modules to function properly

### Phase 2: Core Services (Week 2-3)

#### Parallel Implementation
These tasks can be implemented in parallel by different team members:

**Track A: User-Facing Services**
- Task 2: Authentication (Cognito + API Gateway)
- Task 3: Static Hosting (S3 + CloudFront)
- Task 8: Notifications (SNS + SES)

**Track B: Application Services**
- Task 4: Chat System (AppSync + DynamoDB)
- Task 5: Video Platform (Elastic Transcoder)
- Task 6: Attendance Tracking

**Track C: Data Services**
- Task 7: Marks Management (RDS + EC2)
- Task 10: Monitoring (CloudWatch + CloudTrail)

### Phase 3: Integration (Week 4)

1. **Task 11: CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflows
   - Configure secrets in GitHub
   - Test automated deployments

2. **Task 12: Sample Applications**
   - Create sample frontend applications
   - Implement integration tests
   - Build demo scenarios

3. **Task 13: Documentation**
   - Complete API documentation
   - Create user guides
   - Document troubleshooting procedures

## Working with LLMs

### Effective Prompting Strategy

For each task, use this prompt template:
```
I need you to implement [Task Name] for an AWS Education Platform.

Please generate complete, production-ready code for all files listed.
Follow AWS best practices and include:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Proper logging
- Security best practices
- Cost optimization considerations
- Detailed comments

Here are the specific requirements:
[Paste the entire task content from tasks.md]

Additional context:
- Environment: [dev/staging/prod]
- AWS Region: [your-region]
- Naming convention: education-platform-{env}-{service}-{resource}
```

### Code Review Checklist

After generating code with LLM:
- [ ] Review for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Check IAM permissions (least privilege)
- [ ] Verify resource naming conventions
- [ ] Ensure proper tagging
- [ ] Check for hard-coded values
- [ ] Validate error handling
- [ ] Review cost implications

## Testing Strategy

### Infrastructure Testing
```bash
# Validate Terraform
terraform fmt -check
terraform validate
terraform plan

# Test specific modules
cd terraform/modules/authentication
terraform test
```

### Application Testing
```bash
# Lambda functions
cd applications/lambda-functions/auth-handler
npm test

# Frontend
cd applications/frontend
npm run test
npm run build

# Integration tests
cd tests/integration
npm test
```

## Deployment Process

### Development Environment
1. Always test in dev first
2. Use `terraform plan` to review changes
3. Apply with `terraform apply -auto-approve=false`
4. Monitor CloudWatch logs during deployment

### Staging Environment
1. Promote code from dev branch
2. Run full test suite
3. Perform load testing
4. Validate all integrations

### Production Environment
1. Create release tag
2. Follow change management process
3. Deploy during maintenance window
4. Have rollback plan ready

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Terraform State Issues
```bash
# If state lock issues
terraform force-unlock <lock-id>

# If state corruption
terraform refresh
terraform import <resource>
```

### Permission Errors
1. Check IAM roles and policies
2. Verify service-linked roles
3. Check resource-based policies
4. Review CloudTrail logs

### Deployment Failures
1. Check CloudFormation events
2. Review Lambda logs in CloudWatch
3. Verify API Gateway integration
4. Check service quotas

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Daily Tasks
- Check CloudWatch alarms
- Review error logs
- Monitor cost trends
- Check backup status

### Weekly Tasks
- Review security findings
- Update dependencies
- Performance optimization
- Cost analysis

### Monthly Tasks
- Security audit
- Disaster recovery test
- Capacity planning
- Documentation updates

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- One module per service
- Consistent file naming
- Comprehensive README files
- Version pinning for dependencies

### Security
- Enable MFA for all users
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use AWS Secrets Manager
- Enable GuardDuty

### Cost Optimization
- Use tags for cost allocation
- Set up budget alerts
- Review unused resources
- Use appropriate instance sizes

### Performance
- Enable caching where possible
- Use CDN for static content
- Optimize Lambda memory
- Monitor API throttling

## Next Steps After Implementation

1. **Training**
   - User training sessions
   - Admin documentation
   - Video tutorials

2. **Go-Live Preparation**
   - Load testing
   - Security assessment
   - Backup verification
   - Runbook creation

3. **Post-Launch**
   - Monitor user feedback
   - Performance tuning
   - Feature enhancements
   - Regular updates

Remember: Take an iterative approach. Start with core features and enhance gradually based on user feedback and requirements.
