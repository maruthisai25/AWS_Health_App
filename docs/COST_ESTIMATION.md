## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Right-Sizing Resources

#### Compute Optimization
```bash
# Use AWS Compute Optimizer
aws compute-optimizer get-ec2-instance-recommendations

# Monitor CloudWatch metrics for utilization
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace AWS/EC2 \
  --metric-name CPUUtilization \
  --start-time 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z \
  --end-time 2024-01-31T23:59:59Z \
  --period 3600 \
  --statistics Average
```

#### Database Optimization
- **Performance Insights**: Identify slow queries
- **Read Replicas**: Offload read traffic
- **Connection Pooling**: Reduce connection overhead
- **Query Optimization**: Improve query performance

### 2. Storage Optimization

#### S3 Cost Reduction
```bash
# Implement lifecycle policies
aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration \
  --bucket education-platform-videos \
  --lifecycle-configuration file://lifecycle-policy.json
```

Example lifecycle policy:
```json
{
  "Rules": [
    {
      "ID": "VideoArchiving",
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Transitions": [
        {
          "Days": 30,
          "StorageClass": "STANDARD_IA"
        },
        {
          "Days": 90,
          "StorageClass": "GLACIER"
        },
        {
          "Days": 365,
          "StorageClass": "DEEP_ARCHIVE"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### DynamoDB Optimization
- **On-Demand vs Provisioned**: Choose based on usage patterns
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatic capacity adjustment
- **Global Tables**: Only if multi-region is required
- **TTL**: Automatic data expiration

### 3. Reserved Instances and Savings Plans

#### EC2 Reserved Instances
| Term | Payment | Discount |
|------|---------|----------|
| 1 Year | All Upfront | 40-60% |
| 1 Year | Partial Upfront | 35-55% |
| 3 Year | All Upfront | 60-75% |

#### RDS Reserved Instances
| Instance Type | 1-Year Savings | 3-Year Savings |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| db.r6g.large | 35-45% | 55-65% |
| db.r6g.xlarge | 40-50% | 60-70% |

### 4. Serverless Optimization

#### Lambda Cost Optimization
- **Memory Allocation**: Right-size memory for performance/cost balance
- **Execution Time**: Optimize code for faster execution
- **Provisioned Concurrency**: Only for latency-sensitive functions
- **ARM Graviton2**: 20% better price performance

#### API Gateway Optimization
- **Caching**: Reduce backend calls
- **Request/Response Transformation**: Minimize data transfer
- **Usage Plans**: Control and monetize API usage

### 5. Monitoring and Alerting

#### Cost Monitoring Setup
```bash
# Create cost budget
aws budgets create-budget \
  --account-id 123456789012 \
  --budget file://monthly-budget.json \
  --notifications-with-subscribers file://budget-notifications.json
```

#### Cost Anomaly Detection
```bash
# Enable cost anomaly detection
aws ce create-anomaly-detector \
  --anomaly-detector file://anomaly-detector.json
```
