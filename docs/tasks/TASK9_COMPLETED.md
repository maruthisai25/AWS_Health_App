- **Data Classification**: Appropriate protection levels

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **WAF Blocking Legitimate Traffic**
   - Review WAF logs in CloudWatch
   - Adjust rate limiting thresholds
   - Add IP addresses to whitelist
   - Exclude problematic rules for development

2. **GuardDuty False Positives**
   - Review finding details and context
   - Suppress known good activities
   - Adjust threat intelligence sensitivity
   - Implement custom threat lists

3. **Config Compliance Failures**
   - Review non-compliant resources
   - Update resource configurations
   - Create custom Config rules
   - Implement automated remediation

4. **High Security Costs**
   - Disable non-essential features in development
   - Optimize log retention periods
   - Use cost anomaly detection
   - Review and adjust service usage

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check WAF logs
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name /aws/wafv2/education-platform-dev \
  --start-time $(date -d '1 hour ago' +%s)000

# Review GuardDuty findings
aws guardduty list-findings \
  --detector-id $(aws guardduty list-detectors --query 'DetectorIds[0]' --output text)

# Check Security Hub findings
aws securityhub get-findings \
  --filters '{"ProductArn": [{"Value": "arn:aws:securityhub:*:*:product/aws/guardduty", "Comparison": "EQUALS"}]}'

# Monitor CloudTrail events
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name /aws/cloudtrail/education-platform-dev \
  --filter-pattern '{ $.eventName = "DeleteBucket" || $.eventName = "TerminateInstances" }'
```
