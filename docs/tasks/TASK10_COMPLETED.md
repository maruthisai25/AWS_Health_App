   - Use log sampling for high-volume applications

2. **Missing Metrics in Dashboard**
   - Verify module dependencies are correctly configured
   - Check that resources exist before monitoring module deployment
   - Ensure proper IAM permissions for CloudWatch access
   - Validate resource naming conventions match expectations

3. **Alarm False Positives**
   - Adjust thresholds based on actual usage patterns
   - Implement composite alarms for complex conditions
   - Use anomaly detection models for dynamic thresholds
   - Configure appropriate evaluation periods

4. **CloudTrail Log Delivery Issues**
   - Verify S3 bucket policies allow CloudTrail access
   - Check CloudTrail service role permissions
   - Ensure S3 bucket exists in the correct region
   - Validate CloudWatch Logs integration configuration
