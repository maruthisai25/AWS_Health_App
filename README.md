# AWS Education Platform

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive education platform on AWS featuring:
- User authentication and management
- Real-time chat functionality
- Video lecture streaming
- Attendance tracking
- Marks/grades management
- Push and email notifications
- Comprehensive security and monitoring

## Architecture Components

### Core Services
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito + API Gateway
- **Static Hosting**: S3 + CloudFront
- **Chat System**: AppSync + DynamoDB + OpenSearch
- **Video Platform**: Elastic Transcoder + CloudFront
- **Attendance**: Lambda + DynamoDB
- **Marks Management**: RDS Aurora + EC2 + ALB
- **Notifications**: SNS + SES
- **Security**: WAF + IAM + KMS
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch + CloudTrail + X-Ray

### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions for automated deployments
- Environment-specific pipelines (dev/staging/prod)
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. AWS Account with appropriate permissions
2. Terraform 1.5+
3. Node.js 18+
4. Python 3.9+
5. Git and GitHub account
6. Domain name (optional)

### Using tasks.md

The `tasks.md` file contains 13 detailed tasks that break down the entire implementation into manageable chunks. Each task is:
- Self-contained and can be given to an LLM independently
- Includes all necessary context and requirements
- Specifies exact files to create
- Provides implementation details and best practices

#### How to use with an LLM:
1. Copy the entire content of a single task from `tasks.md`
2. Provide it to your LLM with a prompt like:
   ```
   Please implement [Task Name] exactly as specified below. 
   Generate all the files listed with complete, production-ready code.
   
   [Paste Task Content]
   ```
3. Review and save the generated files
4. Move to the next task

### Required Credentials

Before deploying, you need to set these environment variables:
```bash
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID="your-account-id"
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"  # or your preferred region
export DOMAIN_NAME="your-domain.com"  # optional
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-token"
export DB_USERNAME="admin"
export DB_PASSWORD="secure-password"
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Infrastructure Setup**
   ```bash
   cd terraform/environments/dev
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

2. **Deploy Applications**
   - Frontend: Deployed to S3/CloudFront
   - Lambda: Deployed via GitHub Actions
   - Backend: Deployed to EC2 via Auto Scaling

3. **Configure CI/CD**
   - Set up GitHub secrets
   - Enable GitHub Actions
   - Configure branch protection
